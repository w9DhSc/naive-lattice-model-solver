* usage

First, ensure the [[*dependencies][dependencies]] are met.

SYNOPSIS:

#+begin_example
mn.py [OPTION...]
num_cols and num_rows default to 3 unless specified.
Options:
        -m, --num_cols   Number of columns.
        -n, --num_rows   Number of rows.
        -h               give this help.
        -s               suppress output of solutions
#+end_example

* disclaimer

The program currently uses a very naive brute-force solver, which stucks even for lattices as small as 4x4.

Please let me know if you have ideas on improving the program (the algorithm, in particular).
